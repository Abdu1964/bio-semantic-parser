When different schemas refer to the same biological concept using different
names, ONE canonical English verb is chosen here and all aliases are recorded
in SYNONYM_MAP below. This prevents the same relationship from being stored
under multiple labels in the knowledge graph.

File structure (8 sections)
────────────────────────────
  1. RelationType enum     — 96 approved types organised into 24 categories
  2. EntityType enum       — 85 node types (BioCypher + Biolink aligned)
  3. SectionLabel enum     — document section tags
  4. TAXONOMY dict         — definition + example + not_this for every type
  5. SYNONYM_MAP           — empty stub (moved to tools/build_taxonomy.py)
  6. CROSS_SCHEMA_MAP      — canonical → equivalent name in each source schema
  7. BIOLINK_MAPPING       — canonical → biolink predicate (used by Layer 7)
  8. OPPOSING_RELATIONS    — contradiction pairs (used by Layer 7)

Note on SYNONYM_MAP
───────────────────
The synonym map was an offline audit lookup used only by tools/build_taxonomy.py
to check coverage against external schemas. It is NOT used at runtime — the LLM
normalises predicates directly from the closed taxonomy in the extraction prompt.
Hardcoding synonyms in the runtime schema is the wrong approach for scale; the
correct approach is embedding-based semantic matching if ever needed at runtime.

Growth policy
─────────────
This is a static closed enum — updated offline, not at runtime.
When the extraction engine encounters a relation that fits no type here,
the chunk is routed to the human review queue. A new type is added only
after domain-expert approval and ≥ 3 independent paper occurrences.
